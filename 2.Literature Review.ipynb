    "## Literature Review\n",
    "Why do some images stick in memory while others vanish? And, if we can compose an image by pairing different elements, which pairing strategy makes the whole picture—and a focal object within it—more memorable? Put differently: what compositional rules govern image memorability?\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantities of literature documents viewer-dependent factors (e.g., attention, arousal, expertise) that modulate memory(Angelopoulou & Drigas, 2021; Vaughan & Laborde, 2021; Zsidó, 2024). Yet converging evidence also points to an intrinsic property of images—memorability—the reliable likelihood that an image will be remembered across observers and contexts(Bainbridge, 2019). Notably, memorability is not a simple function of a few features, like attractiveness, novelty(Bainbridge, 2020), and for certain categories (e.g., faces), it appears remarkably stable across changes in viewpoint or emotional status(Bainbridge, 2017). These findings suggest that what is depicted—and how it is composed—plays a central role. Indeed, semantic content is a strong predictor of memorability(Hovhannisyan et al., 2021; Kramer et al., 2023), and compelling work with artworks indicates that artists can deliberately manipulate memorability, whereas naïve observers are relatively poor at predicting it(Davis et al., n.d.). This raises a practical and theoretical question: how can we, naïve observers, compose images—by combining specific elements—to enhance memorability, both for the overall scene and for a target object within it?\n",
    "\n",
    "A key step is to clarify the type of relationships among combined elements. In language learning, for instance, research is mixed on whether grouping semantically related items facilitates or interferes with acquisition(Oppenheim et al., 2010; Rodd et al., 2012), with evidence for both clustering benefits(Sarwat, 2023) and interference(Chasles et al., 2023). What’s more, in vision, information is encoded both in visual features and semantic relations(Feng & Lapata, 2010), and Ishii(2015) found that the visually relatedness could explain the confusion better. These motivate a direct test in images: do semantically similar pairings (A+B) or semantically dissimilar/surprising pairings (A+C) yield higher memorability—overall and for object A specifically? The expectation is that similarity may promote coherent encoding, but distinctiveness may boost salience—two plausible, competing mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "What’s more, differences between semantic relatedness (within the same category) and thematic relatedness (co-occurrence or situational linkage) are worth mentioning. Nah and Geng(2022) found that people often process thematic groups more efficiently (e.g., items that co-occur in daily life), which raises the second question: are images built from semantic “clusters” (within the same category) more memorable than those organized by thematic labels (co-occurrence linkage), or vice versa?\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, recent work suggests that an image’s memorability can be strongly influenced by its most memorable part(Dubey et al., 2015). Yet until recently, systematically and directly testing compositional rules was difficult. Generative AI now makes it feasible to control object identity, style, and layout at scale(Feuerriegel et al., 2024). This enables us to ask: when two elements with known memorability are combined, how does the whole image’s memorability emerge—as the maximum, the minimum, the average, or via a non-linear interaction? And how do spatial arrangement and interaction (e.g., top vs. bottom placement, proximity, occlusion) modulate both overall memorability and the memorability of the focal object (A)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, my research questions are as follows:\n",
    "1.Similarity vs. Dissimilarity\n",
    "When pairing a focal object A with either a semantically similar object B or a semantically dissimilar object C, which composition produces higher overall memorability and higher object-A memorability?\n",
    "2.Semantic Clusters vs. Thematic Groups\n",
    "Do images composed from semantic clusters (within the same category) yield lower memorability than thematic groups (objects linked by co-occurrence/situational roles), or the reverse?\n",
    "3.Compositional Rules & Interactions\n",
    "Given two elements with known baseline memorability, how does combined image memorability arise (max/min/mean/non-linear)? How do spatial arrangement and interactions (e.g., relative position, distance, size) influence overall memorability and object-A memorability?\n",
