"results.csv" contains the results of the pilot samples
- index: the name of the images-combined
- mem_C: the memorability score of the combined image
- max_memAB: the higher memorability score between image A and image B
- min_memAB: the lower memorability score between image A and image B
- avg_memAB: the average score of image A and image B's memorability
- sim_AC: the similarity score between image A and image C (cosine similarity between image-embedding vectors, which are derived using CLIP model)
- sim_BC: the similarity score between image B and image C
- max_simACBC: the higher score of similarity scores between AC and BC
- min_simACBC: the lower score of similarity scores between AC and BC
- mem_max_simACBC: the memorability score of the image(A,B) that is more similiar to image C
- mem_min_simACBC: the memorability score of the image(A,B) that is less similiar to image C
- semantic_similarity: the semantic similarity between two concepts, derived from cosine similarity between two semantic embedded vectors
- category: 4 groups [HS, HD, LS, LD]
